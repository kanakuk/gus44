 * One error resolution was when a part was added, then saved,
 * then modified, then saved, then an error appeared as a duplicate
 * of the part rather than the part being updated
 * The solution was to use an index in the update.
 * .................
 * Another error resolution was moudule-info.java security file at the start to import
 * example parts, I had to find the way to do it in a video.
